# Book Store

## How to launch the project?

1. Launch the database with `cd config` and `docker-compose up -d` 
2. Run Spring boot with Idea // Need to be updated with command line

## Information

The PostgresSQL image used in the docker-composer file is the following: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/

I also use Adminer to make it easier to view the PostgresSQL database. It is an optional development tool that can be removed at any time.
